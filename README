This is a project that aims to create a CLI program to access real time bus data in Trondheim, Norway.
It is in VERY early stages, and not really useful for anyone yet.

So far it can look up the coming departures at a specified bus stop, specified by a node ID.
example:
./atbcli 1601005

atbcli makes heavy use of this work by mpolden:

Thanks! 

This API exports the XML data from the AtB public API to sane JSON.
libjson is then responsible for parsing the JSON data.
